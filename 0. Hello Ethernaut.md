# 0. Hello Ethernaut 

## Notes: 

Intro level. Once you have your instance running, you call

- contract.info() => [[PromiseResult]]: "You will find what you need in info1()."
>The PromiseResult parameter in these calls instruct you what the next calls are
- contract.info1() => [[PromiseResult]]: "Try info2(), but with \"hello\" as a parameter."
- contract.info2("hello") => [[PromiseResult]]: "The property infoNum holds the number of the next info method to call."
- contract.infoNum() => the value of the 'words' array is 42
>Here, you can also type in contract.info and intellesense will tell you what all the available method calls are (info42() being one of those)
- contract.info42() => [[PromiseResult]]: "theMethodName is the name of the next method."
- contract.theMethodName() => [[PromiseResult]]: "The method name is method7123949."
- contract.method7123949() => [[PromiseResult]]: "If you know the password, submit it to authenticate()."
>There are two ways you can find the password, by anlyzing the contract memory in a solidity debugger, or by typing 'contract.' and noticing that there is a password() function that gives you the password. 
>After calling 
- contract.authenticate("ethernaut0")
>The stage is complete. Pretty simple, it is a tutorial stage after all.
